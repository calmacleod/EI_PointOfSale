# Shell Environment Setup

This project uses **mise** for managing runtime versions (Ruby, Node, etc.).

## Before Running Shell Commands

Prefix every Shell tool invocation with mise activation:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc && eval "$(mise activate zsh)" && <your_command>
```

This ensures the correct Ruby, Node, and other tool versions are available.

## Examples

```bash
# Running tests
source ~/.zshrc && eval "$(mise activate zsh)" && bin/rails test

# Running rubocop
source ~/.zshrc && eval "$(mise activate zsh)" && bin/rubocop

# Running migrations
source ~/.zshrc && eval "$(mise activate zsh)" && bin/rails db:migrate
```
