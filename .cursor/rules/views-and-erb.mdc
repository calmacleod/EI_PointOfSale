# Views & ERB

## Styling
- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Use `class: [...]` with `.join(" ")` for conditional classes
- Shared UI lives in `app/views/shared/` (e.g., `_sidebar`)

## Current Context
- Use `Current.user` for the signed-in user (may be nil)
- Use `Current.user&.type` for role display

## Layout
- Use `root_path` for redirects after auth
- Use `link_to` with path helpers; prefer `*_path` over `*_url` for in-app links
